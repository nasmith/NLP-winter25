## Overview

The project for this course is designed to give you an opportunity (1) 
to engage with the current state of NLP research and (2) to contribute 
useful knowledge to members of that community.  
Specifically, your team will choose one paper from the most recent NLP conference 
[EMNLP 2024](https://aclanthology.org/events/emnlp-2024/#2024emnlp-main)
and attempt to reproduce its experiments. (The paper you choose must be from either the 
main EMNLP conference or the Findings volume.  The ACL Anthology URL for a suitable paper 
will contain the string ``main'' or ``findings''; if in doubt, check with course staff.)  
In some cases, this may be a straightforward task.  In some cases, it may be impossible, for 
a range of reasons.

## Teams
Your team should be composed of three people.  
We recommend you include (a) a CSE PhD student actively researching in NLP, (b) 
a CSE PhD student from some other research area, and (c) someone who is not a CSE PhD student.  
Diverse teams are stronger teams; working with people whose perspectives are different from 
yours (both in that particular dimension and in other dimensions) gives you new 
opportunities to learn.

Your project will do one of the following:
1. Reproduce the main experiments in the paper.  Your report will assess the ease of reproducibility, with respect to the checklist we provide below.  In addition, you should attempt at least one additional experiment that isn’t in the paper, but that you are able to conduct after having successfully reproduced the main results.  For example, you could assess the sensitivity of the model to one or more hyperparameters or to the amount of training data, or measure the variance of the evaluation score due to randomness in initial parameters.
1. Report on your failed attempt to reproduce the paper’s main experiments.  Not all papers are easily reproducible. Failing to reproduce the exact results of the original paper is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as your experiments are rigorous. Your report should identify all the questions that would need to be answered to reproduce the experiments, or discuss how the findings appear to be in error (if that is what you discover).
